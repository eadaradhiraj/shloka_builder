# shloka_builder

The purpose is to build a UI to construct sanskrit sentences by using Sandhi and then the software helps in identifying whether the metre fits the shloka conditions, currently supports Anushtup. Plans to accomodate more in the future.

You may build the first line or the first two padas. The script used is Harvard-Kyoto. There are plans to shift to devanagari in the future.
